# Handwritten-character-Recognition-
I have successfully developed Handwritten character recognition (Text Recognition) with Python, Tensorflow, and Machine Learning libraries.  Handwritten characters have been recognized with more than 97% test accuracy. This can be also further extended to identifying the handwritten characters of other languages too.
